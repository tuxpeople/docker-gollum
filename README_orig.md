### gollum-alpine

This is yet another Docker image for [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), a simple wiki that stores documents in a git repository.

[Other images exist](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Gollum-via-Docker#3rd-party-docker-images-at-docker-hub), but they are all quite huge (for example, `suttang/gollum`, an Ubuntu 14.04 based image, is 600+ MB). Like all things Alpine, `adtac/gollum-alpine` is tiny at under 200 MB. Enjoy your extra storage!

#### Usage

Docker is pretty simple.

```bash
$ docker run -i -t -p 8080:8080 -v wiki:/wiki cuotos/gollum-alpine
```

This will pull and run the `cuotos-alpine` image, exposing the website on port 8080, with persistent storage on a docker volume called `wiki`.

Manual flags can be passed to the gollum binary using the environment variable `GOLLUMARGS=`

```bash
$ docker run -i -t -p 8080:8080 -v wiki:/wiki -e GOLLUMARGS="--no-edit" cuotos/gollum-alpine
```

Which will run gollum in "read only" mode and not allowing editing of pages via the ui. handy if this is being deployed remotely
